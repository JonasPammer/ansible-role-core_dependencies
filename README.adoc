An Ansible role for installing the necessary system packages
required for the proper execution of Ansible's core modules
(https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/index.html[`ansible.builtin`] /
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/posix/index.html[`ansible.posix`] /

This role also ensures an up-to-date package cache for most systems.

In most cases, you will want to use this role in combination with my
https://github.com/JonasPammer/ansible-role-bootstrap[`bootstrap`-role].
